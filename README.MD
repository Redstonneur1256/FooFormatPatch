# FooFormatPatch
Foo's client is ignoring `Vars.netServer.chatFormatter`, this plugin forces it to display the formatted message.  
This however comes with a small price, the messages will no longer be shown above player head

Depends on [ModLib](https://github.com/Redstonneur1256/Mindustry-ModLib) for Mixins.
